I am a first-year master's student at Zhejiang University of Technology (ZJUT), with research interests including deep learning, multimodal large models, and computer vision.
I am very fortunate to conduct research under the guidance of Professor Chunhua Shen (https://cshen.github.io/index.html) and Dr. Chenchen Jing (https://jingchenchen.github.io) from the Foundation Model Research Group, School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology.
